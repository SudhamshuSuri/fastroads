    "text": "Why we’re doing it\nWe’re doing it because commuting times don’t have to be this bad and it’s a shame that they are. The longer the commute, the lower the satisfaction with work and life; the length of commuting can also cause damage to health, affecting physical health and causing inactivity (Libin 2022). Commuting time is also directly related to the economic health of a city in certain aspects (David 2021), (Justin 2022)."

    "text": "Welcome to Design Thinkers\nA team of eight students from diverse academic backgrounds who are passionate about solving traffic congestion in urban areas. Our team comprises of Abhirath Sangala (Computational Mathematics), Bhuvana Kanakam (Computer Science and Engineering), Adarsh Saraf, Hiten Sachani, Gokul Mathukumalli, Rajeev Sriramoju, Sudhamshu Suri, and Vaishnavi Teertala (Electronics and Computer Engineering).\n\n\nOur inspiration for the project\nOur motivation for participating in this project is a desire to support for an important cause. We are confident that by working together and leveraging our individual capabilities, we can significantly improve traffic flow and lessen congestion.\n\n\nHobbies\nIn addition to our studies, we enjoy playing sports and spending time with friends and family. We are also passionate about environmental sustainability and are interested in finding ways to incorporate sustainable practices into transportation infrastructure.\nThank you for visiting our website. We hope you find our work inspiring and look forward to hearing from you."

    "text": "As with any project, we have spent a good deal of time trying to concretely formulate the problem we intend to solve while scrupulously omitting any mention of a potential solution. We believe that coming up with a solution prior to having an exact idea of the problem itself is counterproductive; any other, potentially superior stratagies to solving the problem could be completely overshadowed by that one naive solution everyone is already thinking about. After the problem is formulated, we the follow up with the survey portion of our approach where we try to get as much information about the manifestation of the problem and its context as possible. Just as in the previous case, to get unbiased information we have planned to conduct the survey in a controlled manner."

    "text": "A Concrete Formulation Of The Problem\nTraffic congestion is a significant problem in urban areas caused by ineffective traffic signal systems. The fixed-timing pattern of traffic signals leads to long delays, stop-and-go traffic, and wasted fuel.\nThis problem affects : 1. inconvience to commuters - cause delays for emergency services, making it challenging to respond to critical situations quickly. Businesses may suffer losses due to delays in the transportation of goods and services, while commuters may experience increased stress and fatigue due to longer commute times. 2. the environment - produce harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which exacerbate the problem of climate change."

    "section": "Mathematical View Point, According To Our Analysis",
    "text": "Mathematical View Point, According To Our Analysis\nlet’s say that the average travel time for a commuter traveling from point A to point B during peak hours is 30 minutes, whereas the same journey would take only 15 minutes in the absence of traffic congestion. This means that the delay caused by traffic congestion is 15 minutes per trip or 0.5 hours per day for a round trip.\nIf we assume that there are 10,000 commuters traveling between point A and point B during peak hours, then the total delay caused by traffic congestion would be 5,000 hours per day or 1,825,000 hours per year. This translates into significant losses in productivity, increased fuel consumption, and higher emissions.\nTo quantify the environmental impact of traffic congestion, we can estimate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by idling vehicles. According to studies, a typical passenger vehicle emits 1.1 pounds of carbon dioxide per minute while idling. If we assume that a commuter spends 30 minutes per day idling in traffic, then the annual emissions per commuter would be 201.5 pounds of carbon dioxide.\nIf we extend this calculation to 10,000 commuters, the total annual emissions caused by idling vehicles would be 2,015,000 pounds or 907 metric tons of carbon dioxide. This is a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, which can further exacerbate the problem of climate change."

To address this issue, transportation authorities must implement modern traffic management systems that use real-time data to adjust the timing of traffic signals to match the traffic flow, which can help reduce congestion, improve travel times, and enhance the quality of life for commuters.\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nRudementary analysis of traffic signals\nlocation: Ring road square, near jariputka police station, Nagpur.
