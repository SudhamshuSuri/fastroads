## Our approach
As with any project, we have spent a good deal of time trying to concretely formulate the problem we intend to solve while scrupulously omitting any mention of a potential solution. We believe that coming up with a solution prior to having an exact idea of the problem itself is counterproductive; any other, potentially superior stragies to solving the problem could be completely overshadowed by that one naive solution everyone is already thinking about. Next follows the survey portion of our approach where we try to get as much information about the manifestation of the problem and its context as possible. Just as in the previous case, to get unbiased information we have planned to conduct the survey in a controlled manner.

## A concrete formulation of the problem
Traffic congestion is a significant problem in urban areas caused by ineffective traffic signal systems. The fixed-timing pattern of traffic signals leads to long delays, stop-and-go traffic, and wasted fuel. 
This problem affects 
* emergency services
* business productivity
* the environment. 

#### inconvience to commuters
Congestion can cause delays for emergency services, making it challenging to respond to critical situations quickly. Businesses may suffer losses due to delays in the transportation of goods and services, while commuters may experience increased stress and fatigue due to longer commute times.

#### the environment
Idling vehicles produce harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. It also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which exacerbate the problem of climate change.

Furthermore, the traffic signals are not coordinated with each other, resulting in stop-and-go traffic that wastes fuel, increases emissions, and leads to longer commute times for drivers. This issue is compounded by the fact that drivers tend to accelerate quickly when they see a green light, only to be forced to brake suddenly when they encounter the next red light, which can increase the risk of accidents and further worsen traffic congestion.

## In conclusion
the problem of traffic congestion caused by the static traffic signal system is a significant issue that impacts various aspects of urban life. To address this issue, transportation authorities must implement modern traffic management systems that use real-time data to adjust the timing of traffic signals to match the traffic flow, which can help reduce congestion, improve travel times, and enhance the quality of life for commuters.
